<!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
<section>
    <h2>My Approach to Astrology</h2>
    <p>
        Astrology is not about fear, blind predictions, or unrealistic promises.
        It is a science of understanding planetary influences and using that knowledge
        wisely in daily life.
    </p>

    <p>
        My approach focuses on offering balanced and practical guidance that helps
        individuals make confident decisions while maintaining peace of mind.
        Astrology is used as a tool for awareness and direction—not dependency.
